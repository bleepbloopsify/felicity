          Funding forms are filled out at the beginning of a project,
          supplemental budgets and budget modifications throughout the lifetime
          of a project. Supplemental budgets are submitted when the overall
          amount that is being used on a project changes while budget
          modifications are submitted when money is simply being moved from one
          account to another.
