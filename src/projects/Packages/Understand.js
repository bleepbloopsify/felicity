          <b>Packages information is logged in thick binders of paper. It is
          cluttered and inefficient. With the increase in e-commerce, the
          problem will only get worse.</b>
          <br/>
          To understand the situation, I visited several package rooms that will
          adopt the new system. I observed that mailroom employees record
          package information in a binder. If the binder gets too full, a new
          binder is started and the old one is stored away.
          <br/>
          To inform residents that their packages have arrived, a slip with the
          package information is put into the residentâ€™s mailbox.
          <br/>
          With the rise of e-commerce, more packages were being delivered every
          day. The mailrooms were getting cluttered. There is now a higher
          demand for residents to pick up their packages sooner.
