          To understand the problem, I visited several package rooms the new system will be integrated into. Package room employees currently log packages with on sheets of paper kept in a binder. To inform residents that their packages have arrived, a slip is put into a residentâ€™s mailbox.
          <br /><br />
          After the binder has been filled up and packages have been delivered, the papers containing records of the packages were discarded. With the rise of e-commerce, more packages are being delivered every day.
